Overview
This Node.js and Express.js project implements a secure user login and registration system. It uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, Mongoose for MongoDB interactions, and bcrypt for password hashing. This project also integrates various utilities for enhanced functionality and security, including body-parser, cookie-parser, dotenv, multer, and validator.

Features
JWT Authentication: Secure user login and registration with token-based authentication.
Mongoose: Efficiently interact with MongoDB for storing user data.
bcrypt: Hash and salt passwords for secure storage.
body-parser: Parse incoming request bodies.
cookie-parser: Parse and manage cookies.
dotenv: Manage environment variables.
multer: Handle file uploads.
validator: Validate user inputs for enhanced security.
